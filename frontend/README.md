Inventory Management System
Introduction
This project is an inventory management system built with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. It allows users to create an account, log in, and manage their inventory of items.

Getting Started

#Open a terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory.
    
    npm install

Open a terminal window and navigate to the backend directory.

    npm install

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Docker installed on your machine. Once you have Docker installed, you can follow these steps to set up a PostgreSQL database:

#Open a terminal and run the following command to create a Docker container:

    docker run -p 32769:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgrespw -d postgres

#This will create a new container running PostgreSQL, which you can connect to using the following connection string:

    postgres://postgres:postgrespw@localhost:32769/crud
    Replace "crud" with the name of the database you want to use.

#Next, create a .env file in the root of the project and set the PG_CONNECTION_STRING environment variable to the connection string above.

    PG_CONNECTION_STRING=postgres://postgres:postgrespw@localhost:32769/crud


#Once you've set up your database, you'll need to run the following commands to set up the database schema and seed data:

    npx knex migrate:latest
    npx knex seed:run

    This will create the users and items tables in the database and populate them with some sample data.

#Logging In

    To log in to the system, you can use the following credentials:

    Username: johndoe
    Password: password1
    First Name: John
    Last Name: Doe
    User ID: 1

#Using the System
Once you've logged in, you'll see a list of your items. You can use the "Edit" button to edit an item or the "Delete" button to delete it. You can also use the "All Items" button to see a list of all items in the database or the "Create Item" button to create a new item.
